/**
 * A scenery node that rasterizes text.  This is needed due to an issue where text moves in undesirable ways when
 * rotated in Chrome and Firefox, see issue #16 (https://github.com/phetsims/balancing-act/issues/16).
 *
 * This node is not generalized to the point where it is safe to use as a full drop-in replacement for a Scenery Text
 * node.  It has been only tested and worked out for the specific needs of the Balancing Act simulation.
 *
 * TODO: At some point, Chrome and Firefox plan to fix the underlying issues with text rendering.  At that time, it
 * should be possible to replace all usages of this class with regular text nodes.  I (@jbphet) tried replacing this
 * with TextNode on April 11, 2018, and decided that the rasterized version still looked better, so that was the most
 * recent evaluation.
