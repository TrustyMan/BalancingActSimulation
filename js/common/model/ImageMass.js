/**
 * This class defines a mass in the model that carries with it an associated image that should be presented in the view.
 * The image can change at times, such as when it is dropped on the balance.
 * <p/>
 * IMPORTANT: All images used by this class are assumed to have their center of mass in the horizontal direction in the
 * center of the image.  In order to make this work for an image, it may be necessary to have some blank transparent
 * space on one side.
